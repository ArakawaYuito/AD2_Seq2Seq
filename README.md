# Seq2Seq
Anomaly Detection with Seq2Seq. It can convert one sequence to another. LSTM is used for this conversion to avoid the gradient loss problem. The output of the previous step is used for the context of each item. Encoder converts each item into a hidden vector. Decoder transforms the vectors into output items while using the previous output as input.
